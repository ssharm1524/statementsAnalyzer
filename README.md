App Description:
Web app that allows you to upload your Bank of America statements in CSV format which then calls an API to convert that data into a JSON object. The data is processed and stored in MongoDB under a user's email. A user may add multiple statements (ex: one for each month of the year) as long as they use the same email. The app allows you to then view different insights on your transaction data both by individual statements for a month as well as overall across the year.
